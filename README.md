## Welcome to JDT Extension

The motivation is to make Eclipse JDT more powerful and easy-to-use.

### Guava-based hashCode() and equals()

Eclipse provides utilities to generate hashCode() and equals(). But it's the old-style. The generated functions are usually very long, which makes the code hard to read.

Google Guava provides a better solution for it. See [here](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CommonObjectUtilitiesExplained) for more details.

JDT Extension can generate those functions based on Guava, which is shorter, tidy and easy to read.

### Guava-based toString()

The same as hashCode() and equals. Google Guava has better solution to generate toString() function. 

JDT Extension can generate Guava-styled function for your classes.

### Search by Google

Another utility is to put Google search in context menu in Editors/Consoles/Terminals.
